# Blog Content Plan

Purpose: unify content strategy, workflow, calendar, and topic backlog into an actionable plan for tutorials and docs on the same domain.

## 1) Goals & KPIs

- Rankings: target top 20 for core queries within 3 months
- Organic growth: +20% MoM sessions
- Engagement: 3+ minutes time-on-page, <60% bounce
- Conversion: 25%+ clicks from articles to the editor (/web/)

## 2) Content Pillars (site IA mapping)

1. Pixel Art (main) → tutorials under `/tutorials/`
2. Schematics & Blueprints → `/tutorials/`
3. Paintings & Custom Art → `/tutorials/`
4. Building & Roof Designs → `/tutorials/`
5. Skins → `/tutorials/`
6. Command Blocks → `/tutorials/`

Source: docs/content-strategy.md (kept as strategic baseline)

## 4) Templates & SEO Guidelines (from article-template-system.md, normalized)

- Article structure (long-form)

  1. H1 + hook paragraph
  2. Prerequisites/materials list
  3. Step-by-step main content (3–5 sections)
  4. Advanced tips & troubleshooting
  5. FAQ
  6. CTA linking to /web/ and related tutorials

- Requirements

  - ≥1500 words; 5+ internal links; images with alt; meta description ≤160 chars
  - Heading hierarchy H1→H2→H3; ToC for articles >1500 words (optional at first)
  - Consistent tone: beginner-friendly, practical, concise

- Visual style
  - Reuse landing tokens (fonts, spacing); avoid large inline CSS
  - Use callout boxes for Tips/Warnings when helpful

## 5) Workflow & QA (from content-publishing-workflow.md)

- Planning (2–3 days): keyword research, competitor scan, outline
- Writing (3–4 days): content + images + internal links
- Technical (1–2 days): page creation, metadata, canonical
- QA (1 day): grammar, links, mobile, performance, SEO checks
- Publishing & Promotion: build, verify clean URLs, share

Pre-publish checklist

- Title includes primary keyword; meta description; OG/Twitter minimal tags
- Links work; images optimized; focus styles visible
- Mobile readability verified; no console errors; no 404s

## 6) Roadmap (near-term)

- Phase A (now): publish Tutorials index (/tutorials/) and “Getting Started” (/tutorials/getting-started)
- Phase B (Q2 kickoff): 4 articles in 4–6 weeks
  1. Pixel Art Complete Guide (flagship)
  2. Schematics Guide
  3. Paintings & Custom Art
  4. Roof Designs Collection

Metrics: revisit content-calendar-2025.md monthly; align with KPIs.

## 7) Maintenance & Review

- Monthly: publish new piece, refresh one existing piece, analyze KPIs, plan next month
- Quarterly: audit all tutorials, update screenshots/examples, expand internal links

## 8) Ownership & Sources

- Calendar: docs/content-calendar-2025.md (keep, rolling updates)
- Workflow: docs/content-publishing-workflow.md (keep)
- Migrated/retired: docs/blogarticle.md (backlog merged), docs/article-template-system.md (concepts merged)
